yacr-compositions
=================

This site was created on 21 February 2020.  The main reasons for this are:

* Provide simple access to the latest set of peals for the YACR Report Editor and Peal Secretary.
* Make all data publicly available so it is less likely to be lost in the future.

Future goals

* Provide an easy way to check if a composition has been rung before
* Maintain a record of compositions rung by the Yorkshire Association

Todo list:

* Make some search pages
  * Composer
  * Calling
  * Method
  * Year
  
  These would be generated from the "database" as static web pages.

* Transfer the database to github.  The database shoDe would be organized/named in such as way as to make the importable in to an actual database if required.  This would provide maximum visibility of any changes/updates made, and not tie the data to a specific database product.
